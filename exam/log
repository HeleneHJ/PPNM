I can't seem to be able to get it quite right (there seems to be a sign error).
I have made separate plots of the real and imaginary parts of both functions (sin(z) and cos(z)).
Though not as precise as I would have liked, they do seem quite similar to the same plots from WolframAlpha (also in the folder).
