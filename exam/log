Exam project #5: Generalize the ODE solver of your choice to solve ODE with complex-valued functions of complex variable along a straight line between the given start- and end-point.

accuracy: acc=0.001 eps=0.001
npoints=89
start point:	a=0.01+0.01i, end point: b=6.28+6.28i
end point:	b=6.28+6.28i
Function values at start point: y0(a)=0.1+0.0997i 	y1(a)=1+-0.01i
Function values at end point:   y0(b)=1.31+269i  	y1(b)=269+-1.31i
Expected values at end point:	sin(b)=-6.56e-14+268i  cos(b)=268+6.56e-14i
test failed

Though the result is very close to the expected result, I can't seem to be able to get it quite right.
