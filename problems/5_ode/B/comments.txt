It is clear that the larger T_c is, the flatter the curve of 'I' becomes, i.e., the longer between contacts that spread the disease, the fewer people will be infected at one time.
However, this also means that the disease will remain in the population longer.
This model is a simplification that does not take into account the measures implemented to stop the disease from spreading, such as social distancing, and a general 'shut down' of society.
If T_c is larger than T_r, i.e., that the recovery time is smaller than the time between contacts, then there is no epidemic, which is the idea behind social distancing.
